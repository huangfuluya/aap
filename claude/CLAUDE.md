## Build System

ArduPilot uses the Waf build system. Always run `./waf` from the repository root. **Always use `/build` (or `./waf` directly) for all building — never use `autotest.py build.*` for builds.** Use `/boards` to search targets.

### Common Build Commands

```bash
# Configure for a target board (required before first build or when switching boards)
./waf configure --board sitl              # SITL simulator (most common for development)
./waf configure --board sitl --debug      # SITL with debug symbols
./waf configure --board CubeOrange        # Hardware target example

# Build vehicles
./waf copter                              # Build ArduCopter (all multirotor types)
./waf plane                               # Build ArduPlane
./waf rover                               # Build Rover
./waf sub                                 # Build ArduSub
./waf heli                                # Build helicopter variant
./waf AP_Periph                           # Build AP Peripheral firmware

# Build specific target
./waf --targets bin/arducopter            # Single vehicle binary
./waf --targets tests/test_math           # Single test

# List available boards
./waf list_boards

# Run unit tests
./waf configure --board sitl
./waf tests                               # Build all tests
./waf check                               # Build and run tests that changed
./waf check-all                           # Build and run all tests

# Clean builds
./waf clean                               # Clean current board
./waf distclean                           # Clean everything

# Upload to connected board
./waf --targets bin/arducopter --upload

# Generate compile_commands.json for IDE support
./waf configure --board sitl && ./waf --compdb

# Advanced build options
./waf configure --board sitl --enable-littlefs   # Enable LittleFS filesystem
./waf configure --board sitl --enable-DDS        # Enable ROS2/DDS integration
./waf configure --board sitl --consistent-builds # Force version consistency
```

### Running SITL Simulation

Use `/sitl` for interactive launch with automatic vehicle name mapping.

```bash
# Start SITL simulator with MAVProxy
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter           # Copter
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduPlane            # Plane
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v Rover                # Rover
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --debug   # With GDB

# Multi-instance SITL (for swarm/multi-vehicle testing)
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -I 0      # First instance
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -I 1      # Second instance (different port)
```

### Running Autotest Suite

Use `/autotest` for guided test execution with argument parsing. **Always build first using `/build` or `./waf`, then run tests separately:**

```bash
# Step 1: Build the vehicle (use /build skill or ./waf directly)
./waf configure --board sitl
./waf copter

# Step 2: Run tests (do NOT use build.Vehicle - build separately above)
Tools/autotest/autotest.py test.Copter
Tools/autotest/autotest.py test.Plane.QuadPlane
```

## Architecture Overview

### Vehicle Directories

- `ArduCopter/` - Multicopter and helicopter firmware
- `ArduPlane/` - Fixed-wing aircraft firmware
- `Rover/` - Ground vehicle and boat firmware
- `ArduSub/` - Underwater ROV firmware
- `AntennaTracker/` - Antenna tracking firmware
- `Blimp/` - Blimp firmware
- `Tools/AP_Periph/` - CAN peripheral firmware

Each vehicle has a main class (e.g., `Copter`, `Plane`) that inherits from `AP_Vehicle` and implements vehicle-specific behavior including flight modes in `mode_*.cpp` files.

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The `libraries/AP_HAL/` defines the hardware abstraction interface. All hardware interactions go through AP_HAL, making core flight code portable across boards. Platform-specific implementations:

- `AP_HAL_ChibiOS/` - STM32 microcontrollers (most flight controllers)
- `AP_HAL_Linux/` - Linux-based boards (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.)
- `AP_HAL_SITL/` - Software-in-the-loop simulator
- `AP_HAL_ESP32/` - ESP32 microcontrollers

### Key Libraries (in `libraries/`)

**Sensor/IO Libraries:**
- `AP_InertialSensor/` - IMU handling
- `AP_Baro/` - Barometer
- `AP_GPS/` - GPS receivers
- `AP_Compass/` - Magnetometer
- `AP_RangeFinder/` - Distance sensors
- `AP_OpticalFlow/` - Optical flow sensors

**Navigation/Control:**
- `AP_AHRS/` - Attitude and Heading Reference System
- `AP_NavEKF2/`, `AP_NavEKF3/` - Extended Kalman Filter implementations
- `AC_AttitudeControl/` - Attitude controllers
- `AC_PosControl/` - Position controller
- `AC_WPNav/` - Waypoint navigation
- `AP_Mission/` - Mission handling

**Communication:**
- `GCS_MAVLink/` - MAVLink protocol implementation
- `AP_SerialManager/` - Serial port management

**Utilities:**
- `AP_Math/` - Math utilities, vectors, matrices, quaternions
- `AP_Param/` - Parameter system
- `AP_Scheduler/` - Task scheduler
- `AP_Logger/` - DataFlash logging

**Scripting & External Integration:**
- `AP_Scripting/` - Lua scripting engine (see `libraries/AP_Scripting/CLAUDE.md`)
- `AP_DDS/` - ROS2/DDS integration for external control and telemetry
- `AP_ExternalControl/` - Interface for external control sources (DDS, Lua)

### Board Configuration

Hardware definitions are in `libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef/`. Use `/hwdef-info <board>` to inspect a board's definition. Each board has a directory with:
- `hwdef.dat` - Pin mappings, peripheral configuration
- Optional `hwdef-bl.dat` for bootloader configuration

### AP_Periph (CAN Peripherals)

AP_Periph firmware runs on dedicated CAN nodes (GPS, airspeed sensors, etc.). Key patterns:
- Build with: `./waf configure --board <periph-board> && ./waf AP_Periph`
- Modular build flags: `AP_PERIPH_GPS_ENABLED`, `AP_PERIPH_BARO_ENABLED`, etc.
- Each subsystem can be independently enabled for minimal firmware size.
- Peripheral boards defined in `libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef/` with `-periph` suffix.

## C++ Development Guidelines

### Architectural Principles

**Compile-Time Dependency Analysis:**
- Before refactoring or coupling classes, analyze their compile-time dependencies. Check for guards like `#if HAL_CRSF_TELEM_ENABLED` or `#if AP_SOME_FEATURE_ENABLED`.
- A core, non-optional component must never depend on a compile-time optional component. The base system must compile when optional features are disabled.
- Build options are defined in `Tools/scripts/build_options.py` (400+ options). Use `/build-options` to search them.
- Features can be enabled/disabled via `hwdef.dat` files using `define` directives.

**Named Constructor Pattern:**
- Core classes like `Location` use named constructors for clarity and type safety:
```cpp
// Preferred: explicit named constructor
Location loc = Location::from_ekf_offset_NED_m(ekf_origin, offset_ned);

// Less clear: implicit conversions
Location loc = Location(ekf_origin);
loc.offset(offset_ned.x, offset_ned.y);
```
- Use named constructors when intent or coordinate system matters.

**UART Management Models:**
1. **Passthrough/RCIN Mode:** UART managed by high-level frontend; backend is passive consumer of bytes.
2. **Direct-Attach Mode:** Driver assigned specific `SERIALn_PROTOCOL` value, takes direct UART ownership.

**Singleton Pattern:** Many ArduPilot classes are singletons. Only refactor to instantiable class if multiple independent instances are explicitly required.

**Initialization Order:** The `init()` method of a class must only be called after all dependencies are fully constructed and registered.

**Scheduler Integration:** Any feature requiring periodic execution must have its `update()` function called from an appropriate scheduler or main loop.

**Coordinate System Convention:**
- ArduPilot uses **North-East-Down (NED)** coordinate frame for navigation.
- X = North, Y = East, Z = Down (positive Z is below the vehicle).
- Recent refactoring has standardized APIs to explicitly use `_NED` suffix.
- When working with positions/velocities, always verify the expected frame.

### Code Style

**Formatting:**
- 4-space indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- LF line endings
- Braces on their own lines:
```cpp
// Correct:
if (condition)
{
    foo();
}

// Wrong:
if (condition) { foo(); }
```
- Spaces between control statements and parentheses: `if (condition)`
- No spaces between function names and parentheses: `foo(a, 10)`

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use `enum class` instead of raw enums, PascalCase and singular
- Suffix variables/functions with units:
  - Distance: `_m` (meters), `_cm` (centimeters), `_mm` (millimeters)
  - Angles: `_rad` (radians), `_deg` (degrees), `_cdeg` (centidegrees)
  - Rates: `_rads` (rad/s), `_dps` (deg/s), `_mss` (m/s²)
  - Speed: `_ms` (m/s), `_cms` (cm/s)
  - Time: `_ms` (milliseconds), `_us` (microseconds)
- Parameters: uppercase with underscores, most important word first (e.g., `RTL_ALT_MIN`)

**Literals and Math:**
- Use `1.0f` for float literals, not `1.0`
- Prefer multiplication over division: `foo_cm * 0.01f` not `foo_cm / 100.0f`

**Style Verification:** Use `/style-check` for automated checking of modified files.
- Check for trailing whitespace before finalizing changes: `git diff --check HEAD`
- Use astyle to verify formatting of modified code only (never entire files):
```bash
# Check what would change (dry run)
astyle --options=Tools/CodeStyle/astylerc --dry-run path/to/modified_file.cpp

# Apply formatting to specific file
astyle --options=Tools/CodeStyle/astylerc path/to/modified_file.cpp
```
- IMPORTANT: Only format code you have actually modified. Running astyle on entire files that contain unrelated code will create noise in the diff and is not acceptable.
- After running astyle, review the changes to ensure only your modifications were affected.

### Development Constraints

**Memory:**
- No dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `new`) in performance-critical flight code paths
- `new` and `malloc` zero their memory; stack variables must be explicitly initialized
- Be mindful of stack size; avoid deep recursion and large local variables
- Prefer `calloc`/`free` over `new[]`/`delete[]` for arrays - less allocation overhead:
```cpp
// Preferred for arrays:
auto *leds = (SerialLed *)calloc(num_leds, sizeof(SerialLed));
free(leds);

// Avoid for arrays (more overhead):
auto *leds = new SerialLed[num_leds];
delete[] leds;
```
- Prefer embedding objects over dynamic allocation when the object lifetime matches the parent:
```cpp
// Preferred - embedded object:
class Parent {
    Child _child;  // embedded, no heap allocation
};

// Avoid when not necessary:
class Parent {
    Child *_child;  // requires new/delete
};
```

**Debugging:**
- No `printf`; use `gcs().send_text()` for GCS messages
- `hal.console->printf()` acceptable for debug code compiled out by default

**API Verification:**
- Before calling any ArduPilot API, verify in the header file: exact name, full signature, const correctness, namespace/singleton access pattern
- Never invent or assume function signatures; if uncertain, check the source

**Type Safety:**
- Use `static_cast` for arithmetic/bitwise operations with mixed integer types:
```cpp
// Correct:
uint32_t val = (static_cast<uint32_t>(payload[1]) << 8) | payload[0];

// Wrong:
uint32_t val = (payload[1] << 8) | payload[0];
```

### Comments and Documentation

**Parameter Documentation:** All `AP_Param` parameters require documentation blocks:
```cpp
// @Param: RTL_ALT
// @DisplayName: RTL Altitude
// @Description: The altitude the vehicle will return at.
// @User: Standard
// @Units: cm
// @Range: 200 8000
AP_Int16 rtl_alt;
```

**Code Comments:**
- Every function declaration should have a comment explaining its purpose
- New `.h` and `.cpp` files should start with GPLv3 license and purpose description
- Comments explain "why", not just "what"
- Comments must be descriptive statements about code operation, not development process notes

### Surgical Modification Principle

When modifying existing files:
- Limit changes strictly to the scope of the request
- No unrelated refactoring or style changes
- Produce the smallest possible diff
- Never remove existing code (defines, constants, helpers) unless directly required by the change

## Commit Conventions

- **Atomic Commits:** Each commit represents a single logical change
- **Each Commit Must Compile:** Every commit must leave the codebase in a buildable state. Order changes so dependencies are added before code that uses them.
- **Checkpoint Commits:** During development, create checkpoint commits when reaching milestones to avoid losing work. These can be squashed or cleaned up later before final PR submission. Good checkpoint opportunities:
  - After completing a logical unit of work (e.g., adding a new struct, implementing a function)
  - Before attempting risky refactoring or experimentation
  - When all tests pass after a significant change
  - Before running tools that modify files (like formatters)

  Always verify the build succeeds before creating a checkpoint: `./waf copter` (or appropriate target)
- **One module per commit:** Each commit must only touch files from a single subsystem/module. Never mix changes to different libraries or directories in one commit. If a feature requires changes to multiple modules, split into separate commits per module.
- **Squash per subsystem:** When squashing commits, group by subsystem prefix (AP_GyroFFT, RC_Channel, Tools, etc.)
- **DO NOT list Claude as author or co-author** - commits should only show the human author
- **Message Prefix:** Subject line prefixed with the specific subsystem or directory name, not a generic parent directory. Use the most specific prefix that matches the changed files:
  - `libraries/` changes use the library name: `AP_AHRS:`, `AC_PosControl:`, `AP_Scripting:`
  - `ArduCopter/`, `ArduPlane/`, `Rover/` etc. use the short vehicle name: `Copter:`, `Plane:`, `Rover:`
  - `Tools/` subdirectories use the subdirectory name as the prefix:
    - `Tools/scripts/` uses `scripts:` (e.g., build option changes)
    - `Tools/ardupilotwaf/` uses `ardupilotwaf:` (e.g., library list changes)
    - `Tools/AP_Bootloader/` uses `AP_Bootloader:` (e.g., board ID additions to `board_types.txt`)
    - `Tools/bootloaders/` uses `bootloaders:` (e.g., bootloader binary additions)
    - `Tools/autotest/` uses `autotest:` for autotest changes
  - `libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef/` uses `AP_HAL_ChibiOS:` for hwdef additions
  - Examples:
    - `AP_AHRS: Refactor loiter controller`
    - `autotest: Add test for new NAV_CMD`
    - `Copter: Fix altitude hold in mode_althold.cpp`
    - `AP_Bootloader: add board ID for NewBoard`
    - `bootloaders: add NewBoard bootloader binaries`
    - `AP_HAL_ChibiOS: add NewBoard hwdef`
    - `scripts: add build option for new feature`
    - `ardupilotwaf: add library to vehicle dependent list`

## Git Safety

- **NEVER run `git clean` without explicit permission** - this removes untracked files which may include important local configuration or notes
- If git clean is absolutely necessary, first backup untracked files to a safe location
- Prefer `git checkout` or `git restore` to discard changes to tracked files
- **Verify rebased commits before force pushing:** After rebasing or squashing, verify the final tree content matches the original by comparing relevant files:
  ```bash
  # Compare specific files between original and rebased commits
  git diff <original-commit> <rebased-commit> -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2
  # Empty output means files are identical
  ```

## Testing

Use `/check` for unit tests, `/autotest` for integration tests. Unit tests use Google Test framework in `libraries/*/tests/`. Tests require SITL board configuration.

```bash
./waf configure --board sitl
./waf --targets tests/test_math
./build/sitl/tests/test_math
```

**Autotests:** Vehicle behavior tests are Python scripts in `Tools/autotest/`. Add new tests as methods to appropriate test suite (e.g., `arducopter.py`).

## Lua Scripting API Design

When designing C++ APIs for Lua interaction:
- No C++-to-Lua callbacks; all interactions initiated from Lua
- Lua scripts are sandboxed and cannot share state directly
- For shared event queues, use peek/pop pattern allowing scripts to check ownership before consuming
- Protect shared C++ state with mutexes when accessible from Lua

## Lua Applet Autotest Lessons Learned

### Autotest Structure for Lua Scripts

When writing autotests for Lua applets in `Tools/autotest/arducopter.py`:

1. **Script Installation Sequence:**
   ```python
   # 1. Enable scripting first
   self.set_parameters({"SCR_ENABLE": 1})
   self.reboot_sitl()

   # 2. Install script (creates parameters on next boot)
   self.install_applet_script_context('my_script.lua')
   self.reboot_sitl()

   # 3. Wait for script initialization message BEFORE setting script params
   self.wait_statustext("Script loaded message", check_context=True, timeout=30)

   # 4. NOW set script-specific parameters (they exist after script runs)
   self.set_parameters({"SCRIPT_PARAM": value})
   ```

2. **Context Collection Timing:**
   - Call `self.context_collect('STATUSTEXT')` immediately after `context_push()`
   - Do this BEFORE any reboots or actions that might generate messages you want to catch

3. **SITL Speedup Considerations:**
   - Tests run at high speedup (~100x), so time-based logic completes very fast
   - Data collection that expects "real flight time" may get insufficient samples
   - Relax data requirements or use sample counts rather than time durations
   - Example: Accept `total_samples >= 50` instead of requiring specific bin fill levels

4. **Multiple Test Phases:**
   - When running multiple test phases, `check_context=True` matches ALL messages ever collected
   - For subsequent phases needing fresh messages, either:
     - Use `check_context=False` (waits for new messages only)
     - Clear context between phases
     - Use unique message strings per phase
   - Timing can be tricky - message may arrive before `wait_statustext` starts listening

5. **Protected Wrapper Pattern:**
   - When using `pcall(update)` in Lua, capture ALL return values:
     ```lua
     local success, result, interval = pcall(update)
     return protected_wrapper, interval or 100  -- Don't lose the interval!
     ```

6. **Mode Transitions:**
   - Scripts that change flight modes (e.g., to LOITER on completion) affect subsequent test phases
   - Explicitly set required mode before each test phase:
     ```python
     self.change_mode('GUIDED')  # Ensure correct mode before next test
     ```

### Test Method Registration

Add new test methods to the appropriate test list in the test class:
```python
# In tests_scripting list (for scripting-related tests)
self.ScriptMyNewTest,
```

### Checkpoint Commits

**Always checkpoint after major milestones:**
- After all tests pass
- Before major refactoring
- When switching between implementation phases

Use atomic commits with proper prefixes:
- `AP_Scripting: Add feature X` - for Lua scripts
- `Tools: Add autotest for feature X` - for test code

# Bash Guidelines

## IMPORTANT: Avoid commands that cause output buffering issues
- DO NOT pipe output through `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `more` when monitoring or checking command output
- DO NOT use `| head -n X` or `| tail -n X` to truncate output - these cause buffering problems
- Instead, let commands complete fully, or use `--max-lines` flags if the command supports them
- For log monitoring, prefer reading files directly rather than piping through filters

## When checking command output:
- Run commands directly without pipes when possible
- If you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g., `git log -n 10` instead of `git log | head -10`)
- Avoid chained pipes that can cause output to buffer indefinitely
